# ImageToTextScraper

This is an automation script to web scrape info elements from hardcoded website.

This is definitely not a production ready script and it needs fixes but it gets job in this specific case.

Job that otherwise would have taken few days to copy all the data from web to csv file now took only a couple of hours.

The usual web scraping would not have worked in this scenario because of non-consistent html tags used.
